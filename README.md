- Node.JS

Following Node Modules are used:
- dotenv - for securing api keys
- express - for server side logic
- body-parser - for parsing the body data
- multer - for uploading images
- path - for working with path and file extensions
- fs - for working with file system
- deepai - for using the deep ai mechanism
- lodash - for working with lowercase strings

## API Used:
It uses an advanced image colorization api powered by DeepAI.org

How to run the web app?
<br>
Run:
```
npm install
```
inside the project directory to install all node dependencies.
<br>
Create a .env file inside the root directory of the app, and get your free api key from DeepAI.org, and paste it inside the .env file. Start your express server thereafter by typing:
```
node index.js
```
Now, open up a browser and visit - [127.0.0.1:3000] to checkout the app.
